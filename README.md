## AR Display Simulation
In order to simulate the limited field of view that is common in AR HMDs, a plane was attached to the main virtual camera that mimicke an AR lens. It followed the movement of the camera at all times.
The plane was scaled to 60% of the cameraâ€™s original field of view. Additionally, we further simulated an AR display within the virtual environment by adding a degree of transparency to the virtual plane.
The alpha value of the plane was set to 60. 
[Customized shaders](https://github.com/zy0531/AR-Navi-VR-Simulation-in-Varjo/blob/main/CScape/Assets/Scenes/Portal.shader) with stencil buffers were used for rendering AR cues that could only be seen within the range of the simulated lens. Objects that were used to represented [AR cues](https://github.com/zy0531/AR-Navi-VR-Simulation-in-Varjo/blob/main/CScape/Assets/Scenes/BackObjects.shader) were assigned corresponding stencil referencing numbers to be displayed half transparently and in front of any other virtual objects regardless of the actual depth relationships.
